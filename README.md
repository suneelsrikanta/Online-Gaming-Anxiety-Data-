Online Gaming Anxiety Data

This project aims to analyze the intricate relationship between gaming habits and psychological well-being using a comprehensive global dataset of gamers. By examining various gaming behaviors, such as playstyles, the duration of gameplay, and the types of games played, the project seeks to uncover how these factors impact mental health indicators like General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Satisfaction with Life (SWL), and the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). 
The objective is to identify patterns that highlight which specific gaming habits can be either beneficial or detrimental to playersâ€™ mental health. 
For instance, understanding whether certain playstyles, such as cooperative or competitive gaming, lead to greater social connectivity or increased anxiety will provide crucial insights. This analysis will ultimately inform the optimization of game features designed to encourage healthier gaming practices, helping to foster a gaming environment that supports improved mental health outcomes for players
